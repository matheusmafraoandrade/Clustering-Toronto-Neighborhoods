INTRODUCTION
There are lots of factors that can cause a car accident and define its severity. Weather, road conditions, number of cars, among other reasons can influence a car crash and the severity of the injuries on the people involved.
With that in mind, drivers should consider those factors before getting into the car or taking a specific way. For example, drivers would prefer not to drive under rain conditions and would get a road in which there are less cars.
Thus, this project intends to analyse all factors that influence a car accident and its severity to help drivers choose the best time or road to drive.
